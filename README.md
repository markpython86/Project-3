# Minimalist
A minimal journaling app that guides users through daily, weekly, and monthly self-reflections. Intentionally minimal. Incredibly powerful.

### Purpose and Usefulness
Machines are great at taking in data and course correcting. Humans aren't as great, it turns out. Even though self-reflection is essesstial to our growth, surveys show that people would rather receive small amounts of electic shocks than have to sit for 15 minutes doing nothing but self-reflection. Minimalist takes the pain out of this process by making self-reflection quick, easy, and helpful. Three questions at the end of every day, three questions at the end of every week, and three questions at the end of every month. All of a sudden, you might notice trends when you look back on your week or month. The included habit tracker also helps you see your habits grow over time. It's all about growth over time. When you take minimal time to do minimal journaling, you'll find the rewards aren't minimal.
